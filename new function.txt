Video QC (image)

- Legal range / gamut control: flags luma and chroma out of broadcast-safe limits.
- Interlacing / combing detection: catches interlaced artifacts in progressive exports.
- Letterbox / pillarbox detection: finds black bars where they should not be.
- Blur / out-of-focus detection: flags soft shots (with false-positive controls).
- Blockiness / compression artifacts: detects macroblocking via heuristics or AI.
- Dead / stuck pixel detection: finds persistent bad pixels.
- PSE / flash test: detects potentially epileptic flashing.
- AI on-screen text QA: OCR + grammar check for titles and supers.

Audio QC

- Loudness detail: momentary, short-term, integrated, LRA, true peak, and out-of-tolerance segments.
- Phase correlation / stereo issues: mono compatibility and phase warnings.
- Pops / clicks, DC offset, noise floor: flags spikes, hum, and drift.
- Channel layout checks: validates count and order (L/R/C/LFE/dual mono).

File format & integrity control

- GOP / codec compliance: keyframe interval, B-frames, profile, and level.
- VFR / CFR control: timestamp discontinuities and dropped frames.
- A/V sync drift: audio ahead/behind detection.
- HDR checks: HDR10/Dolby Vision metadata, MaxCLL/MaxFALL.

Pro/Agency upgrades

- Version comparison (diff): SSIM/PSNR/VMAF over time, highlight worst moments.
- NLE marker export: send report markers to Premiere/Resolve.
- Custom QC presets: thresholds, tolerances, and pass/fail rules.
- Frame grabs per issue: thumbnails in every report.
